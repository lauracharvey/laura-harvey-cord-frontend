With the provided resources, please create a small project that implements a working version of the mocked UI.

You may use a single HTML file and raw CSS/JS or you can use tools like create-react-app, whatever you prefer. Remember, we're looking at your code â€” use NPM packages very sparingly. This doesn't need to be a carefully factored UI library. We're interested in your overall code quality, clarity, simplicity, and correctness. We don't need this to be a production-ready, professional grade UI with test coverage and rich documentation. Be pragmatic and, most importantly, don't spend hours on this. Two to three hours is more than enough time to create something workable.
